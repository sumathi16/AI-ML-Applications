## Artificial Intelligence

### Who
The term artificial intelligence was first coined by **John McCarthy** in 1956 when he held the first academic conference on the subject.

### What

It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.-**John McCarthy**

### when 
After WWII, a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician **Alan Turing** may have
been the first. He gave a lecture on it in ***1947***. He also may have been the first to decide that AI was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines.
