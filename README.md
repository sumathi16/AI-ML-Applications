## Artificial Intelligence

### Who
The term artificial intelligence was first coined by **John McCarthy** in 1956 when he held the first academic conference on the subject.

### What

It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.
